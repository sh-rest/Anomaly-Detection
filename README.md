# Data-Stream-Anomaly-Detection
 This project implements a real-time anomaly detection system using Z-Score for detecting short-term spikes and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) with Standard Deviation for identifying long-term trends. The system efficiently processes streaming data, identifying both sudden and gradual deviations in behavior with optimized performance for real-time analysis.
